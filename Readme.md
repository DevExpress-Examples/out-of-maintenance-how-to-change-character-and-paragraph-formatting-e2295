# How to change character and paragraph formatting


<p>This example illustrates how you can highlight the selected text and center the paragraph containing the selection via code. In other words, it illustrates how the RichEditControl's API can be used to change formatting of characters and a paragraph.</p><p><strong>Notes for versions prior </strong><strong>to </strong><strong>10.2:</strong><br />
RichEdit template included in this example is used to hide the bottom panel of RichEditControl and to create a command button in the RichEdit's command bar. This button holds a caption "TEST" and executes the code that modifies character and paragraph characteristics.<br />
RichEdit control's scrollbars are hidden intentionally to demonstrate the use of corresponding properties.</p>
